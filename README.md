# !important
This repository is now in read-only state. Since the maintainer of WayFarer Toolkit abandoned 
all work on Wayfarer tools, there is no development for WayFarer Toolkit anymore.

I'll leave this repository online for reference.

You will find an alternative in my [Wayfarer Extension Scripts](https://github.com/AlterTobi/Wayfarer-Extension-Scripts).


# WayFarer-Toolkit-Userscripts
Userscripts created to work with [WayFarer Toolkit](https://github.com/MrJPGames/WayFarer-Toolkit)

These scripts re-implement some of the original WayFarer+ functionality.

## branches
- **release**
    - stable version of scripts
- **dev**
    - scripts still in development
